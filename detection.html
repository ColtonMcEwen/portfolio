            <p>
                To be honest, I've worried about doing a senior project since I
                started college. I often heard about amazing, creative projects
                that students have done in the past. I wanted to make something
                cool, but my mind always came up blank.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leading up to the last semester of my Senior year, I finally
                came up with an idea. What if I could develop a browser
                extension that detected any news-based website to be real or
                fake?
            </p>
            <img class="portfolio-item__img" src="img/news-detection.jpg" alt="" />

            <p>
                Turns out, that's exactly what I did. It's certainly not perfect
                but it's a start. A combination of Python, Javascript, HTML,
                CSS, and Machine Learning made this possible by taking a couple
                of data sets each containing over 1 thousand real and fake news
                articles to be crawled, scraped, stripped, stemmed down to the
                bare text.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the data was prepared, each article was organized and sent
                to a database containing a corresponding URL, its stemmed words,
                and a score of 1-4 ranging from False, Sketchy, Mostly True, and
                True.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next was training the data using built-in Python libraries like
                SciKit-learn. This library used a variety of training models to
                test with such as MLPClassifier, SVC, and LogisticRegression.
                Typically, these models gave pretty good percentages. Well, at
                least better than a coin toss!
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking these percentages finally meant that I could put this
                into a little browser extension window to display the final
                score to determine whether or not it was deemed real or fake.
            </p>
            <p>
                This enabled a user to go to any news-based website and wait for
                the browser extension to collect all data from the page and
                prepare the data mentioned earlier to run against the trained
                models I had made to determine a score.
